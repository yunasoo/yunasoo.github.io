## Introduction
The role of AI in education is a tool that students can utilize for learning assistance. It's almost like a 24 hour remote tutor. Although we shouldn’t heavily rely and fully believe what AI tells us (nothing is perfect), the functionality of it being interactive and personalized tailored to each unique individual is useful. Students have different ways of learning at different speeds, so using AI will be useful as it helps students with personalized study methods and advice.

In relevance to Software Engineering, students can ask AI for help when they need help understanding the functionality of a section of code, help explain a concept, help explain errors and bugs, and help scan a section of code for syntax errors students may have not noticed.

In ICS 314, I use ChatGPT to help me figure out why I’m getting errors and bugs in my code. Not only does it suggest possible solutions, it also provides optional tips to consider to prevent future bugs. Sometimes when my thoughts get jumbled up, using ChatGPT helps me organize and structure my ideas more clearly. In general, I use ChatGPT to help me understand difficult concepts in my other classes. I take advantage of its interactive feature by asking a lot of “why” and “how” questions to understand why things work the way they do. ChatGPT does a good job at summarizing large chunks of text so, I prefer to read a simplified version first to get a basic understanding of something, then go back to read the original version of the text to get a more in depth understanding.
