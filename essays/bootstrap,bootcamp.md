## Analogy
Baking a cake from scratch requires gathering specific ingredients, following detailed procedures, and using the right techniques to produce a high-quality result. However, using cake flour sold at supermarkets simplest the process, requiring fewer ingredients, less time, and fewer steps while still producing a good cake. Similarly, building a webpage with plain HTML and CSS can be time-consuming and complex requiring software developers to write extensive code. UI frameworks like Bootstrap acts like the cake flower, they provide prebuilt designs and styles allowing the process of creating a web page more efficient for developers.

## Bootstrap Disadvantages and Advantages
Although Bootstrap 5 may seem convenient, it can be almost as complicated as learning a new programming language because there are so many things to account for. We can bother to use Bootstrap 5 because it provides a variety of features and designs like navigation bars, footers, format, textboxes, forms, etc, to be easier to implement rather than making a bunch of shapes and CSS classes. Bootstrap 5 also has a big variety of icons we can use to visually display links and visuals. Out of the return of frustration and time, we could get a full website to be almost functioning and soon be ready for many people to navigate around it. One benefit is that Bootstrap 5 is reusable and consistent.

## Personal Experience
During my experience of using Bootstrap 5, I wanted to create navigation bars. I was amazed by the output of a visually functioning HTML page and the difficulty because it would’ve been more difficult to create all the same features from scratch. It is very frustrating but a good learning experience, more practice with Bootstrap 5 will make the experience a lot more enjoyable. The images attached are one of my attempts to recreate a section of a website which didn’t use Bootstrap 5, with Bootstrap 5. The one on the left is the original, the one on the right is my recreation. Even though they still look very different, I got some hands-on experience along with learning new features.
