Creating a website from scratch would be tedious as you mess around with margins, shapes, formats, and so on, that you just wished that there is already something that you can type and it can just implement everything. An analogy would be like baking a cake from scratch versus using cake flour sold at supermarkets. Baking a cake from scratch takes more time, work, and more procedures, so cake flour became a thing to make it easier to bake a cake from home still having an acceptable quality. Using plain HTML and CSS is the same thing, it can get very messy, long and inconvenient. But with Bootstrap 5, a UI framework, it serves as the cake flour, to help implement the long and difficult step. 

Although Bootstrap 5 may seem convenient, it can be almost as complicated as learning a new programming language because there are so many things to account for. We can bother to use Bootstrap 5 because it provides a variety of features and designs like navigation bars, footers, format, textboxes, forms, etc, to be easier to implement rather than making a bunch of shapes and CSS classes. Bootstrap 5 also has a big variety of icons we can use to visually display links and visuals. Out of the return of frustration and time, we could get a full website to be almost functioning and soon be ready for many people to navigate around it. One benefit is that Bootstrap 5 is reusable and consistent.

During my experience of using Bootstrap 5, I wanted to create navigation bars. I was amazed by the output of a visually functioning HTML page and the difficulty because it would’ve been more difficult to create all the same features from scratch. It is very frustrating but a good learning experience, more practice with Bootstrap 5 will make the experience a lot more enjoyable. The images attached are one of my attempts to recreate a section of a website which didn’t use Bootstrap 5, with Bootstrap 5. The one on the left is the original, the one on the right is my recreation. Even though they still look very different, I got some hands-on experience along with learning new features.
