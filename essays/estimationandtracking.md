## Making Effort Estimates
I estimated the amount of effort I needed to make based on the amount of time I took to do the WOD assignments, and referencing how long I took to do my tasks for each of the milestones for our final project. I took a bit long to do each task so while I was predicting how long I need to take for each of my tasks for each milestone, I underestimated myself and wrote down an additional hour from my original intuition. Me and my teammates have a spreadsheet with all of our estimates and actual effort so we can plan together who should help with what if another person could not complete one task. It also helped us visually see if the times we predicted will fit within a week or two for each milestone. There were a few tasks that needed to be broken down into smaller ones which were easier to estimate how long it will take to complete.
