Any learning concept in the world comes with its own challenges, but the effort is always worth it. Whether it’s learning different programming languages, a new instrument, or a second language, each pursuit adds meaningful value to life. These experiences inspired me to believe that I am capable of achieving so much more.

## Experiences
My minimal experiences with HTML, CSS, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript has shown me that while their structures are similar, their unique capabilities offer creative ways to express ideas. I just learned JavaScript and TypeScript, and as for now, I prefer them because of their simplicity.

Practice is the most important factor to learning. Its usefulness teaches me what I need to improve, how to handle pressure, and what to remember for next time. Overtime, my performance of doing athletic software engineering has increasingly improved which led me to enjoy learning in general. Along with the help of AI, Chat GPT is a useful tool for me to understand new concepts, and grammar tips on how to write more clear and precise.

Reflecting on hands-on experience askes me, is this something that I want to pursue? Writing code enhanced my creativity and critical thinking. Practicing violin for hours may feel tedious, but the thrill and the final outcome makes it an enjoyable hobby. Learning Korean has been confusing at times, but in the end, it allows me to connect with my family and communicate with more people around me.

## It's still the beginning
There is still plenty of time in life despite not having enough hours in a day, but every hour is worth learning something new. The difficulties that I’ve faced taught me to prove my worth. First, to myself, then to others. These challenges have helped me build confidence and overcome misunderstandings, allowing me to show what I am truly capable of.
