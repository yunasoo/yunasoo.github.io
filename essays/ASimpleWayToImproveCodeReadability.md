## Importance of Coding Standards
When it comes to learning a new programming language, there are many features to consider. Usually when you learn something new, there would be multiple examples for understanding a topic. It is important for those examples to be clear and easy to follow. Enforcing coding standards is a valuable habit. It is like a guideline or a style that is beneficial for yourself and other developers. Coding standards enhance code readability, clarity, consistency, and maintainability. Additionally, when debugging or modifying code, well structured code makes it easier to identify and solve issues efficiently.

## ESLint: The Coding Standard Tool
ESLint is a useful tool that applies coding standards while coding on a platform. Although dealing with ESLint’s errors and warnings can be frustrating, it provides insight for developers on what to watch out for next time when coding. Engaging with tools like ESLint, practicing, making mistakes and correcting them is one of the most effective ways to learn. It helps us retain the information based on hands-on experience. 

## My Experience with ESLint
When I started using VSCode with ESLint, I was impressed by how useful the tool really was. Previously, when coding on other platforms or writing code by hand, I found that working without an assistant made the process more challenging leading to self doubt. It’s like writing code blindly without understanding my own work. However, while ESLint was really helpful, I was struggling with syntax errors and warnings which prevented me from testing my code. Despite the challenges, I understood the importance of coding standards and how I can use them to improve my code.
