## What is Doodle for Google?
Doodle for Google is an annual art competition open to students from K-12 living in the U.S. to show off their creativity by designing a Google logo based on a given theme. The prize for the winning doodle gets to be featured on the Google homepage and the artist receives scholarships and other prizes. In 2022, the 14th annual contest, the theme is self care. Students were asked to share how they take care of themselves in tough times.

## My Interpretation of Self Care
This was an individual project where we practiced the graphic design process. After briefing through the project requirements, I researched what self care is, which involves intentional actions to improve and maintain our physical and mental well being. 

For my brainstorming, I sketched 10 designs of some objects in the shape of the letters “Google”. I found plants, fruits, pets, tea, and watching the sunset to be relaxing, healthy, and comforting. I narrowed down my ideas to 3 and created a rough draft. I refined my design and used Adobe Illustrator and used the shape and paintbrush tool. I asked a classmate for a peer review and I did the same back with their project, then finalized my project. I turned in my project once it was completed and my graphic design teacher entered the whole class’ submissions into the competition.

## Learning Experience
Although my artwork didn’t win, the experience strengthened my design process skills and my understanding of self care. I learned more about myself and how I prefer to take care of myself in tough times. I also learned a few more editing tools on Adobe Illustrator to help improve details in my art. Seeing my classmates’ projects, including the winning design, gave me the chance to see their perspectives on self care.
