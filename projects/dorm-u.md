## What is Dorm-U?
---
DormU is an web application that allows University of Hawaii at Manoa dormitory residents to easily communicate with other residents on the same floor of their building and as well as keeping touch with their resident assistant (RA). Each user customize a profile about themselves, posts their thoughts, and as well as connecting with other members of the community.

The purpose of this application is to help the resident advisors build connections in the community throughout their floors and improve communication. One special feature in this application includes the availability to request and send mealshare points among other residents. With these point transactions, residents can share extra points they have to other residents who are in need.
